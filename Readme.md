This is my webdev final project which is a personal website about me.
It contains information such as projects, skills, and classes I've taken -- as well as how to contact me.

In order to run the code, either open the index.html file in a browser, or,
alternatively the site is hosted with github pages at:

reidluttrell.github.io
